# Amazona - E-commerce Platform (Developer Documentation)

This document provides a detailed overview of the Amazona e-commerce project, its architecture, and setup instructions for local development.  
It is intended for developers who will be working with the source code.

---

## Project Overview

Amazona is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
It serves as a practical example of a modern single-page e-commerce platform with both a customer-facing storefront and an admin management panel.

---

## Features

### Customer Features
- **Product Discovery:** Browse and search for products with keyword search. Filter by category or sort by price or newness.  
- **Shopping Cart:** Persistent shopping cart that saves items even after leaving the site.  
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).  
- **Checkout Flow:** Multi-step checkout process including shipping address entry, payment method selection, and order summary.  
- **Payment Integration:** Pay for orders using the PayPal API.  
- **User Profile:** View order history and update profile information.

### Admin Features
- **Product Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.  
- **Order Management:** View and manage all customer orders.  
- **Image Uploads:** Upload product images, with support for local storage and AWS S3.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React:** Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements.  
- **Redux:** Global state management for user, product, and cart data.  
- **React Router:** Client-side routing for single-page application experience.  
- **Axios:** HTTP client for API requests.  
- **js-cookie:** For storing user session data in cookies.

### Backend
- **Node.js & Express.js:** RESTful API framework for routing, requests, and responses.  
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing product, user, and order data.  
- **Mongoose:** ODM library for data modeling and validation.  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Secure authentication for users and admins.  
- **Multer:** Middleware for handling file uploads.  
- **AWS S3:** Optional cloud storage for images.

## State Management with Redux

The frontend uses Redux to manage global state.

**Data Flow:**
1. **Action:** User interacts with a React component (e.g., clicks "Add to Cart").  
2. **API Call:** The action creator makes an asynchronous API call to the backend.  
3. **Dispatch:** The action creator dispatches a new action with a type and payload.  
4. **Reducer:** The reducer updates the state based on the dispatched action.  
5. **Store Update:** The Redux store is updated with the new state.  
6. **Re-render:** Components subscribed to the store automatically re-render.

**Key Redux states:**
- `userSignin`
- `productList`
- `cart`

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18.x or higher)  
- MongoDB installed and running

---

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:

```bash
# backend/.env
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/amazona
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=sb

# Optional: AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=
````

---

### Installation and Running the Application

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazona.git
cd amazona

# 2. Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# 3. Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

# 4. Run the backend
cd ../backend
npm start

# 5. Run the frontend
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

The application will be available at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

### Seeding the Database

To populate the database with sample data:

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

---

## API Endpoints

All backend routes are prefixed with `/api`.
